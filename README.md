# School project of Introducing to Software Engineering course

This is a website which allows you to exchange secondhand commodities. Admin page is for administrator to approve or decline a post by a user, usually things that they want to sell. Client page is for users, a user can be a buyer or seller. This prototype is similar to chotot.vn.

Open the project folder, then open the terminal/console window and run these 2 commands: npm i and npm start, finally visit localhost at port 3001 (Client site) or port 3000 (Admin site)
